# Hey there! üëã  
Aspiring Software Developer on a journey from Psychology and Retail into the tech world. I've never faced struggles quite like these, and I‚Äôve never been more excited to solve problems. Every new challenge makes me feel more alive in this world of code! Ready to build solutions that connect both people and technology.
