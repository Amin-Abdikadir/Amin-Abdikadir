Hi! 

Aspiring Software Developer on a journey from Psychology and Retail into the tech world. I've never faced struggles quite like these, and Iâ€™ve never been more excited to solve problems. Every new challenge makes me feel more alive in this world of code! Ready to build solutions that connect both people and technology. As Carl Rogers said, 'The only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and change.' Follow my journey and connect with me on LinkedIn!
